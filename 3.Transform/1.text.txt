Transform Objects :-
POSITION => 
mesh.position.length 
mesh.position.distanceto(camera.position)
mesh.position.normalize() => this will reduce the length to 1 => go and see mesh.position.length before and after
mesh.position.set(x,y,z);

AXES HELPER =>
it is an object so it has to be add in scene
it is simply the axis got created
(const axeshelper = new THREE.AxisHelper(length))


SCALE =>
change the length of the object in x y and z direction
mesh.scale.set(x,y,z);


ROTATION OBJECTS :-
mesh.rotation.axis = value 
pi => for half rotation (180degree)
